    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing a convolutional neural network is mainly empirical. So I tried several preprocessing techniques, and different architectures as described here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "First I tried converting the images to different colorspaces. On the final chosen arquitecture I got 98.54% for RGB (original images), 98.88% for simple grayscale conversion, 98.56% for YUV using all channels and 98.58% using only the Y channel. I got very similar results for each colorspace, with the best results being for grayscale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actualy, the results look all the same, and because of the randomicity of the augmented training set, ideally, I should have ran a couple times with each configuration and taken the average, but due to time constraints, I didn't take this approach. Furthermore, for each colorspace, there could be a different ideal tunning of preprocessing and model architecture, specially on 1 versus 3 channels, but again, because of limitations, I did all the tunning with grayscale (the simplest, and most performing), and then compared it the other colorspaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a second step I normalized the images so each pixel ranges from -1.0 to 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "As suggested by Yann Lecun in [this paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf), in order to make the model more robust I augmented the training set with randomly tranformed samples of the original images. I have done many trials arbitrarily tweaking each of the transformation parameters, getting the best results with a combination of rotation between -20 and 20 degrees, translation between -3 and 3 pixels and scaling to between 26 and 36 pixels. Also, I noticed thet most of the mispredictions on the validation set, were images with very high brightness levels, so I added one more preprocessing step, in which I randomly increase or reduce the image's brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the same samples shown above after the preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][preprocessed]\n",
    "\n",
    "I have also tried applying all kinds of noise type (e.g. gaussian, salt&pepper, ...), The accuracy was lower with the random noise than without it, regardless of the noise type, probably, because of the low resolution of the images, the other tranformations were already making enough noise on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the training set was very unbalanced, therefore the features of the most present signs could stand out over the least seen ones. Additionally I treid increasing more and more the size of the training set, but after a threshold, the final accuracy started to fall. Hence I ended up with 5,000 images of each sign, making a total of 215,000 images on the training set.\n",

    "#### 2. Model architecture.\n",

    "#### 3. Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, I used an Adam optimizer over the softmax cross entropy with a learning rate of 0.0001, and a batch size of 128 through 150 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "My first approach was to use the Lenet5 implementation shown in the classroom adjusted to a 3 color channels input image, only normalizing the image on the preprocessing step, 10 epochs and 0.001 learning rate for model training. With this configuration, the validation accuraccy reaches a maximum of 0.93, then decreaces after epoch 6, ending up with a test accuracy of 0.90. This result suggests a possible overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to handle the overfitting I added a dropout layer after each fully connected layer reaching 0.956 accuracy for validation and 0.929 for testing. Then I tried several configurations varying the number and size of layers, and adding dropout layers after every RELU (including the convolution layers). On the table below I show the architecture at that stage:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the images #6 and #13, originaly came from the same image, making it a total of 13 traffic signs to classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Images # 3, 4, 6, 9, 10 and 12 might be difficult to classify because of too much information on the background.\n",
    "* Images #5 might be difficult to classify because the sign is too small in the image and there are not much contrast/color variations.\n",
    "* Images #6 might be difficult to classify because of the angle of the point of view.\n",
    "* Images #10 might be difficult to classify because there seems to be a sticker on the lower part of the sign.\n",
    "* Images #13 might be difficult to classify because of the angle of the point of view, and because there is a shadow.\n",
